Thinking of a good meal somewhere but can't decide to go there?

Lazy Foodie helps you quickly decide on a restaurant or eating place you are interested in. Lazy Foodie provides you with the rating of a restaurant, the cuisines served there, and how much should a meal for two ideally cost.  

For example, you can ask:
- "Alexa, ask Lazy Foodie what's the rating for Hakkasan in Mayfair"
- "Alexa, ask Lazy Foodie how costly is Otto's Pizzeria in Brooklyn?"
- "Alexa, ask Lazy Foodie what does Bukhara in Chanakyapuri specialize in?"

When you're feeling hungry, Lazy Foodie is the ultimate tool for you to help make up your mind!
